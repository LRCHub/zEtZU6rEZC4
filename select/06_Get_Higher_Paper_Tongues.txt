When you step in the room
They won't be holding me down
All these demons in my head
Come on let's kill them with sound

You see I'm begging that you take me
And you never look back
That's why I'm crying to a wall
Hoping that you come now

Hey, I don't wanna wake up from this
I cannot afford to forget
The feeling of your arms, they hold me
The power of your skin, it's lovely

You provoke a man to bow down
And I get on my knees and cry out
"Everything I have is yours now"

So the time is now
Don't let me down
Oh, the time is now
Please don't let me down

Get higher and higher, and higher
When my back's against the wall
You're the hand that breaks my fall

Climb higher and higher, and higher
When my back's against the wall
You're the hand that breaks my fall

Take me to a place for romance
You can choose the space and for this
I can hardly breathe it's so deep
My hands begin to shake with frailty

You will not escape my embrace
'Cause I'll be holding on with violence
Everything I have is yours now

So the time is now
Just don't let me down
Oh, the time is now
Please don't let me down

Get higher and higher, and higher
When my back's against the wall
You're the hand that breaks my fall

Climb higher and higher and higher
When my back's against the wall
You're the hand that breaks my fall

When you step in the room
They won't be holding me down
All these demons in my head
Come on let's kill them with sound

You see
We finally get a message that we're gonna breakout
I say we wrestle all the angels 'til they give us a crown

You know
We're gonna live forever if we hold to love
So don't you leave me when you know
That I'm feeling your touch

You see
I'm begging that you take me and you never look back
That's why I'm crying to a wall hoping that you come now

Get higher and higher and higher
When my back's against the wall
You're the hand that breaks my fall

Climb higher and higher and higher
When my back's against the wall
You're the hand that breaks my fall

Ooh woah oh oh, ooh woah, oh, oh
I'll wait for you
Ooh woah oh oh, ooh woah, oh, oh
I'll wait for you

Ooh woah oh oh, ooh woah, oh, oh
I'll wait for you
Ooh woah oh oh, ooh woah, oh, oh
I'll wait for you

Ooh woah oh oh, ooh woah, oh, oh
I'll wait for you
Ooh woah oh oh, ooh woah, oh, oh
I'll wait for you

You're my fire, you're my fire
