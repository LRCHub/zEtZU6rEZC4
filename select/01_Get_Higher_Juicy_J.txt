Explain [Hook: Juicy J]
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then light it
Pop a Molly, drink some orange juice, get higher
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then light it
Pop a Molly, drink some orange juice, get higher
(Get higher), get higher, (get higher), get higher, (get higher)
Pop a Molly, drink some orange juice, get higher
(Get higher), get higher, (get higher), get higher, (get higher)
Pop a Molly, drink some orange juice, get higher

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Juicy J be throwed
Body movement slow
All a nigga do is sip lean and fuck hoes
Smoking with a queen
And she popped a bean
Call my niggas over, and let her fuck the team
And I'm taking drags
From the volcano bag
Pop off a couple of Mollies, reaching for the hash
I'm so fucked up, playing PS3
I'm bout to start a fire, Juicy J TNT
Mansion in Tennessee
Drinking on Hennessy
And my crib in Cali look like a dispensary
Toss that roach, where the lighter
Kief in the blunt, nigga get higher

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Trippy as a fool, I got that double cup addiction
All these pills I'm popping, I'm in the water like I'm fishing
Two foreign bitches
And I got 'em kissing
Marijuana ménage à trois, nigga that's the mission
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Swisher full of pizzurp
Molly got the white girls going straight berserk
Styrofoam cup, nigga this ain't no Icee
I put hash on top of the weed like motherfucking icing
Can't no nigga do like me
This Bubble Kush, no licence
Copped a whole pound, this trippy life enticing
Your main bitch my groupie, I see why you don't like me
I put Molly on the tounge, of any nigga wifey

[Hook]
