This song here is a special treat, we don't always get to do it
But we thought we'd do it here for you this evenin'
It's a song by a cat named Matt Nathanson
It's called "Come On Get Higher"

I miss the sound of your voice
And I miss the rush of your skin
And I miss the still of the silence
As you breathe out and I breathe in

If I could walk on water, if I could tell you what's next
I'd make you believe, I'd make you forget

So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire in the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard and drown me in love

So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire in the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard and drown me in love

I miss the sound of your voice
The loudest thing in my head
And I ache to remember
All the violent, sweet, perfect words that you said

If I could walk on water, if I could tell you what's next
I'd make you believe, I'd make you forget

So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire in the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard and drown me in love

So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire in the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard and drown me in love

I miss the sound of your voice, I taste the sparks on your tongue
And I see angels and devils and God when you come on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
La-la-la

Sing, sha-la-la-la (sha-la-la-la)
Sing, sha-la-la-la (sha-la-la-la)
Sing, sha-la-la-la (sha-la-la-la)
Sing, sha-la-la-la, keep it going

(Sha-la-la-la-la, come on, get higher, loosen my lips)
Sing, sha-la-la-la (faith and desire in the swing of your hips)
(Sha-la-la-la-la, pull me down hard)

Sing, sha-la-la-la (drown me in love)
(Sha-la-la-la, come on, get higher, loosen my lips)
Sing, sha-la-la-la (faith and desire in the swing of your hips)
(Sha-la-la-la, pull me down hard)
Sing, sha-la-la-la (and drown me in love)

So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire in the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard and drown me in love

So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire in the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard and drown me in love

Drown me in love (and drown me in love)
Drown me in love
Drown me in love
Because everything works in your arms

Thank you
