I woke up to the sound
Of a man who's always been
But never been around
And he told me
How to change my ways
And stop with the childish games
So I told the man no
I'm never ever going to change
This's who I am
Gonna feel my own pain
Haven't been here in years
And it's not your choice
Gonna do what I want
Cuz I'm not a little boy

I Get Higher
I Get Higher
I'm gonna set this house on fire
Shut off the lights I hear your sound
I'm locking the door as you fall to the ground
I Get Higher
I Get Higher
The sun is shining I'm on fire
I walk the streets I hear no sounds
My shiny blue eyes turn to painful brown

In the park where I sat down
Saw the pay-phones ringing
So I answered the sound
I need another quarter
Man keeps on talking
Don't know where it went
Must've lost it in my pocket

I Get Higher
I Get Higher
I'm gonna set this house on fire
Shut off the lights I hear your sound
I'm locking the door as you fall to the ground

And I get higher
Oh
And I get higher
Alright
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
And I can't take it all

Alright
Come on now
Ohhh
Here we go

I Get Higher
I Get Higher
I'm gonna set this house on fire
Shut off the lights I hear your sound
I'm locking the door as you fall to the ground
I Get Higher
I Get Higher
I'm gonna set this house on fire
I walk the streets I hear no sounds
My shiny blue eyes turn to painful brown

Ohhh, Yeahh
I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
And I can't take it all
