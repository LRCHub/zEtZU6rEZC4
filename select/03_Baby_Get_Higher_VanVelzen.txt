You gotta flow, like a river
Heading the same way forever
I love you, I love you, I love you
And I'm trying to figure out
How to make it better

If you don't hide away inside
You'd find your wings would open
So free your mind and you will fly

Chorus:
Baby get higher
You know that's all I'm asking for
Baby get higher
I don't think I can take no more
You're bringing me down
You're stuck on the ground
How do I turn this thing around
Baby get higher

You're stuck in a groove
Like a record
You don't even know
What you're looking for
And you never, never
Never see that I'm trying, no
I want you to feel
So much more

Let it all out, just scream and shout
Tear down the walls around you
So free your mind and you will fly

Chorus

If you don't hide away inside
You'd find your wings would open
So free your mind and you will fly

Chorus
